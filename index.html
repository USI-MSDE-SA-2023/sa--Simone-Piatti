        <p>demo</p>
<h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>
<p>You will
use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheetplan">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adr/madr">architectural decision records</a>,
feature models and connector views to describe a software architecture model about your own project.</p>
<p>This document will grow during the semester as you sketch and refine your software architecture model.</p>
<p>When you are done with each task, please push so we can give you feedback about your work.</p>
<p>We begin by selecting a suitable project domain.</p>
<h1 id="ex---domain-selection"><span class='task'>0.</span>  Domain Selection</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Submit the name and brief description (about 100 words) of your domain using the following vision statement template:</p>
<pre><code>For [target customers]
Who [need/opportunity/problem]
The [name your project]
Is  [type of project]
That [major features, core benefits, compelling reason to buy]
Unlike [current reality or competitors]
Our Project [summarize main advantages over status quo, unique selling point]
</code></pre>
<p>Please indicate if your choice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a project you have worked on in the past (by yourself or with a team)</li>
<li>a project you are going to work on this semester in another lecture (which one?)</li>
<li>a new project you plan to build in the future</li>
<li>some existing open source project you are interested to contribute to</li>
</ul>
<p>The chosen domain should be unique for each student.</p>
<p>Please be ready to give a 2 minute presentation about it (you can use one slide but it&#39;s not necessary)</p>
<section class="hint"><span>Hint: </span>to choose a meaningful project look at the rest of the modeling tasks which you are going to perform in the
context of your domain.</section></section><p>Project Name: Warehouse Management System</p>
<p>Project Type: a project I have worked on in the past</p>
<p>Vision Statement: This project is for shops with a local warehouse that need to manage the stock of their products. The
warehouse management system is a web application that allows the shop to manage the stock of their products both locally
and remotely. The system allows the shop to add new products, to update the stock of the products, to see the list of
products and to see the details of a product. The system is different from other systems because the user host its own
database and he can use a smartphone or a webcam to read barcodes to update the stock of the products.</p>
<p>Additional Information: Each product can have multiple barcodes depending on how much it contains, for example if a
product has a packet with 10 units with its own barcode it can be registered in the system to make faster operations but
if a product has two different barcodes, since they might changes in time, it can have two barcodes for the single unit.</p>
<h1 id="ex---architectural-decision-records"><span class='task'>1.</span>  Architectural Decision Records</h1>
<section class="instructions"><p>Software architecture is about making design decisions that will impact the quality of the software you plan to build.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s practice how to describe an architectural decision. We will keep using ADRs to document architectural decisions in
the rest of the model.</p>
<p>Use the following template to capture one or more architectural design decisions in the context of your project domain</p>

<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>The machine that runs the server also runs the database.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>To improve the stability and the performance of the system, I need to decided where to run the database and the server with thinking about the budget that a final user can have.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>The system must have very good performance and stability, and the budget of the final user is limited.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Run the database and the server in two different machine.</li>
<li>Run the database in the same machine that runs the server.</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>The second one: Run the database in the same machine that runs the server.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main reason is that the server machine is a very powerful machine, and the database is not a very heavy database, so the performance and the stability of the system will be better if the database runs in the same machine that runs the server.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>More performance.</li>
<li>More stability.</li>
<li>Less cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>If the server machine fails, the database will fail too.</li>
<li>If the server machine is very slow, the database will be very slow too.</li>

<h3></h3><h2 id="adr-02-export-stocks">ADR #02: Export stocks</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>The user has the ability to export the stocks to a CSV file.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some user may want to do some analysis on the stocks they have. In order to do that, they need to export the stocks to a file that can be read by other programs.
For example, a user may want to export the stocks to a spreadsheet program to do some analysis on the stocks or to check if the stocks are correct with the one he has in real life.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>The user may already have some programs that can read the data from a file and do some analysis on the stocks.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The user can export the stocks to a CSV file.</li>
<li>The user can export the stocks to a JSON file.</li>
<li>The user can export the stocks to a XML file.</li>
<li>The user can export the stocks to a PDF file.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one: The user can export the stocks to a CSV file.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The main reason is that the CSV file is the most common file format for spreadsheets and for data analysis and it is the most common file format that can be read by other programs.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user can export the stocks to a CSV file and do their own analysis on the stocks without needing to use this program.</li>
<li>This program still simple and easy to use since it doesn&#39;t have to do any analysis on the stocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any, list the negative consequences (cons)</p>
<ul>
<li>The user may not be able to do some analysis on the stocks because the CSV file doesn&#39;t have all the information that the user may need.</li>
<li>The user may not have a program that can read the CSV file and do the analysis that the user wants to do.</li>
</ul>

<h3></h3><h2 id="adr-03-product-barcodes">ADR #03: Product barcodes</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Each product can has multiple barcodes with different types (EAN, UPC, etc.) and each barcode correspond to a precise amount of that product. For example, a product can have 2 barcodes, one with 1 unit and another with 10 units.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some product can be stored in different ways, for example, a product can be stored in a box of 10 units or in a box of 100 units. In this case, the product will have 3 barcodes, one with 1 unit, one with 10 units and another one with 100 units but, since the are different amounts of the same product the need to be stored as one product.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</li>
</ol>
<p>The user must be able to store the same product in different way and the system must know how many units of that product are in the inventory.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Each product can has only one barcode that correspond to 1 unit of the product.</li>
<li>Each product can has multiple barcodes with different types (EAN, UPC, etc.) and each barcode correspond to a precise amount of that product.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>The second option: Each product can has multiple barcodes with different types (EAN, UPC, etc.) and each barcode correspond to a precise amount of that product.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The user must be able to store the same product in different way and it is necessary to know how many units of that product are in the inventory.</p>
<p>List the positive consequences (pros) of your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user can store the same product in different ways.</li>
<li>The data of the inventory is more accurate.</li>
<li>The database is more organized.</li>
<li>The number of barcodes is not limited.</li>
<li>The number of products represent the real one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Developing an app natively for each OS is expensive and time consuming, but it benefits from a good performance.
Choosing a cross-platform environment on the other hand simplify the development process, making it faster and cheaper,
but it might suffer in performance.</p>
<h2 id="simplicity-vs-compatibility">Simplicity vs. Compatibility</h2>
<p>Developing a system that is simple to use and understand is a good thing as developing an system that can be integrated
with various other products.
But when we want to make our system simple to use and understand but also compatible with various other products the
chances that the product becomes complex to use and the architecture of the product becomes complex are very high.
That also makes the system even more difficult to develop and maintain.</p>
<h2 id="performance-vs-modifiability">Performance vs. Modifiability</h2>
<p>To develop a system that is fast and efficient we probably need to use some code tricks, optimizations and rely on
execution side effect to make the system faster.
This approach can make the code more complex and difficult to understand and even small changes can have a big impact on
the system performance and make the system slower.
On the other hand, if we want to make the system easy to understand and modify we probably need to reduce the use of
code tricks and optimizations and don&#39;t rely on execution side effects.</p>
<h2 id="usability-vs-portability">Usability vs. Portability</h2>
<p>Developing a system that is easy to use and understand might rely on some specific features of a specific OS or
hardware, but it will increase the modification need to make the system runs on different OSs with minimal modification.
Different platforms and OSs impose different constraints and offer variable usability characteristics.</p>

<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>(1) Should we find cases where two components cannot communicate (and are doing it wrongly) and highlight they would
need an adapter?, or cases where we have already a &quot;component playing the role of adapter in the view&quot; and highlight
only the adapter?</p>
<p><em>Both are fine. We assumed that if you draw a dependency (or a connector) the interfaces match, but if you detect that
the components that should communicate cannot communicate then of course introduce an adapter to solve the mismatch</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>(2) Please show the details about the two interfaces which do not match (e.g., names of parameters, object structures)
so that it becomes clear why an adapter is needed and what the adapter should do to bridge the mismatch</p>
</li>
<li><p>(5-6) These questions are about the implications on coupling based on the decisions you documented in the connector
view.
Whenever you have a connector you couple together the components and different connectors will have different forms of
coupling</p>
<p>For example, if you use calls everywhere, do you really need them everywhere? is there some pair of components where
you could use a message queue instead?</p>
<p>Regarding the coupling facets mentioned in question 5. You do not have to answer all questions related to &quot;
discovery&quot;, &quot;session&quot;, &quot;binding&quot;, &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;timing&quot;, &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; (p.441, Coupling Facets). Just
the ones that you think are relevant for your design and by answering them you can get ideas on how to do question 6.</p>

<h2 id="solved-mismatches">Solved mismatches</h2>
<h5 id="operation-granularity"><strong>Operation granularity</strong></h5>
<p>The three databases connectors play the role of adapters between the &quot;operation handler&quot; and the three databases because
the &quot;operation handler&quot; can not talk directly to the MongoDB databases.
This adapters is also necessary because the &quot;operation handler&quot; need to do some complicated operation on the databases
that imply to make a lot of call to the databases and it may cause some problems to the final users.</p>
<p><img src="./puml_13.svg" alt="Logical View with wrapper"></p>
<h2 id="standard-interfaces">Standard interfaces</h2>
<p>The standard interfaces that are used in this system are:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP/HTTPS for the communication between the <em>two web interfaces</em> and the <em>express server</em></li>
<li>SQL for the communication between the databases wrapper and the three databases</li>
<li>JSON object to communicate between the express server and the operation handler and also between the operation handler
and the databases wrapper</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coupling">Coupling</h2>
<p>In this part we will analyze the coupling n between the two web interfaces (<em>mobile web interface</em> and <em>desktop web
interface</em> ) and the <em>express server</em>.
The components doesn&#39;t share a state since in each request done to the <em>express server</em> all the data needed are passed.
The components are coupled by the <strong>interaction</strong> and <strong>timing</strong> facet because they need to communicate with each other
to exchange the data for the operation that the user need to do and they need to be available at the same time.
Since the system is a web based application the Interface/API of the express server and the platform on which it run can
changed without affecting the two web interfaces.</p>

<li>Full plan : 1000 products, 100 simultaneous clients == 4.99 CHF/month</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also think a plan for big business that wil change the price based on the number of connected clients and number
of product stored</p>
<ul>
<li>Business plan: 9.99 fixed + 0.19 * new client + 0.09 * product for each month</li>
</ul>

<p>The system must be always available during working time so the planned downtimes must be during the night time for less
than 3 hours and the longest response time tolerated by your clients, during day time, must be less than 1 hour.</p>

<h3>ADR</h3><h2 id="adr--monitor-strategy">ADR : Monitor strategy</h2>
<ol>
<li>What did you decide?</li>
</ol>
<p>Use a watchdog to monitor the availability</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What was the context for your decision?</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s necessary to select a monitor strategy to check the availability of the service.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Which alternative options did you consider?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>watchdog</li>
<li>heartbeat</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which one did you choose?</li>
</ol>
<p>A watchdog strategy.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is the main reason for that?</li>
</ol>
<p>The watchdog can be used to also monitor if each part of the service is working correctly and also measure the response time to check if it is necessary to improve the server capacity to keep the availability.</p>

<p>Operation handler goes down
<img src="./puml_18.svg" alt="Sequence diagram"></p>
<h2 id="6">6</h2>
<h2 id="7">7</h2>
<p>Since I have opted to use a watchdog I can use it to prevent overloaded servers using the response time for some types
of request and so limit the probability of cascading failures.
Other way to limit cascading failure is to create a new operation handler dedicated for users that will have a high
number of concurrent clients since they can generate a high number of request and so they will be divided on the
different handler</p>

<p>The only external dependency of this system is &quot;html5-qrcode&quot; which will always be available as it runs locally in the
user&#39;s mobile phone.</p>

<section class="instructions"><p>Only dead software stops changing. You just received a message from your customer, they have an idea. Is your
architecture ready for it?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pick a new use case scenario. Precisely, what exactly do you need to change of your existing architecture so that it
can be supported? Model the updated logical/process/deployment views.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick another use case scenario so that it can be supported without any major architectural change (i.e., while you
cannot add new components, it is possible to extend the interface of existing ones or introduce new dependencies).
Illustrate with a process view, how your previous design can satisfy the new requirement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change impact. One of your externally sourced component/Web service API has announced it will introduce a breaking
change. What is the impact of such change? How can you control and limit the impact of such change? Update your
logical view</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open up your architecture so that it can be extended with plugins by its end-users. Where would be a good extension
point? Update your logical view and give at least one example of what a plugin would actually do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming you have a centralized deployment with all stateful components storing their state in the same database,
propose a strategy to split the monolith into at least two different microservices. Model the new logical/deployment
view as well as the interfaces of each microservice you introduce.</p>
